To get started, first download the MNIST dataset (including both the training and testing subsets) from the following web links:
• https://s3.amazonaws.com/jrwprojects/mnist_train_images.npy
• https://s3.amazonaws.com/jrwprojects/mnist_train_labels.npy
• https://s3.amazonaws.com/jrwprojects/mnist_test_images.npy
• https://s3.amazonaws.com/jrwprojects/mnist_test_labels.npy

Softmax regression and GDS algorithms was implemented by Numpy from scratch in this MNIST NN machine learning model.
